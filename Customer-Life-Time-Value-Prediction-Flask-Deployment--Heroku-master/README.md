# PROJECT GOAL

#### This project is designed to predict the CUSTOMER LIFE TIME VALUE of four wheeler insurance company using Regression Analysis with Python, FLASK, HTML, SQL 
#### A highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, feature selection, model building, evaluation and MLR assumptions validity steps explained in detail.

# Project Motivation

**Every Organization runs with the goal to get a profit from their product and customers, most of the organization is workig hard without compromizing quality of products to help those organization business requirement, this project has been designed**
