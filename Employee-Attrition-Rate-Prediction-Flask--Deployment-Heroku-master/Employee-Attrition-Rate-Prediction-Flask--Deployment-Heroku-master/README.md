# PROJECT GOAL

#### This project is designed to predict the E  MPLOYEE ATTRITION RATE Iin corporate organization or  company using Regression Analysis with Python, FLASK, HTML, SQL 
#### A highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, feature selection, model building, evaluation and MLR assumptions validity steps explained in detail.

# Project Motivation

**Every Organization runs with the goal to get a profit from their products, most of the organization is workig hard with support of employed professionals so Attrition is important to consider, so its motivated me to do this project**
